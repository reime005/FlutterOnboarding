# Flutter Onboarding Screens

The idea behind this example is the implementation of an app onboarding experience in Flutter. Works on Android and iOS.

This was inspired by a post [on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/14926348-App-onboarding-design). The SVG files are from [unDraw](https://undraw.co).

## Example

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row">
  <img src="1.PNG" height="400px" />
  <img src="2.PNG" height="400px" />
  <img src="3.PNG" height="400px" />
</div>
